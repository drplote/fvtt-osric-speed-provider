# Osric Speed Provider

A [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) speed provider for OSRIC. Reads from the "Move" attribute of a PC/NPC to determine their speed. Expects the number to be in feet.

Has a configurable option for if you want the color to change for every 1/10th movement, making it easier to move incrementally.
